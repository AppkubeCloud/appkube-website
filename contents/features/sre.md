Problem Statement --
    All enterprises today need to adopt modern microservices / serverless architecture in multicloud hybrid environemnt for business agility , scalability , flexibility. Every enterprise has many products and their environments and corresponding app and data services floating across multiple clouds.Managing the cost 
and sla's of millions of services spread across multiple clouds is of exponential complexity.

Remedy --
-   Right tools that process billions of data points of millions of services in multicloud hybrid environment and deliver high data revenues.

How Appkube Helps:

    Enterprise today have multiple products owned by different departments, deployed across multiple clouds.Each products has multiple environment, many services and components. Managing all the Development/ Security/ Operation aspects of them posing exponential complexity and thereby causing huge Opex. It takes significant time to provision the cloud environment for any product for any team without having self service based provisioning portal and it also takes tremendous effort to establish monitoring and visibility of products and their services - especially the Performance / Availability / Reliability / Security / End Usage of every participating components once the products are deployed in cloud.Customers are looking for a single control plane to manage any clouds and any services in same way.They are looking for platform to do self service based provisioning and reclaiming of the cloud assets.They are also looking for standard operation and governance process that works seamlessly for all cloud in same way.Finally they look for simplicity to manage multicloud hybrid environment.

Appkube platform discovers all services residing on any cloud and any infrastructure, whether they are legacy 3 tier apps or container/serverles modern apps. It allows to manage the services lifecycle (create/ deploy/ update/ delete / getstats / scale), continously collect the SLA (performance / Availability / Reliability / End Usage / Security &Compliance/ Data protection) and Cost statistics from different data sources and deliver a business friendly KPA's to measure service reliability.It will gather a billion data points on every small details of services and calulate its SLA's like performance , availability , reliability , endusage , security in realtime and predicts on customer experience based on proven AI models.Appkube platform corelates your infrastructure with business apps and helps you dig details from services to bottom of infra, to a extent of you data spindle path. Its bird eyes views of all services for every products helps you to identify and optimize your infra and continously improves your customer experince along with the lowering of capex and opex. Appkube draws a clear visibility of service development perspective. It helps you to have more control on dev processes if you are building your own product and services.
