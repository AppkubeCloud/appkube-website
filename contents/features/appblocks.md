Problem Statement --
     All enterprises today need to build high quality cloud native microservices / serverless product and solutions in less time and cost with less code.Also they are continously looking for way to migrate and modernize their existing legacy applications in less time.

Remedy --
-   Deliver basic building blocks of any product with the composure of cloud native managed services along with services lifecycle so that customer can deliver products and services quickly in any cloud with flexibility of architecture selection. 

How Appkube Helps:

Every enterprise product have set of common fetaures, such as Search, Security/RBAC,Preference/config managemnet , DMS(document management system),CMS(Content Management system), Workflow management , Datafow management , Artifact catalogue , Policy manager , Alert management , Realtime analytics , OLP, Static reporting , Script central.Also Different applications have different requirements, that we call as Application specific business blocks.Enterprise often spends a lot of time in writing those common services for multiple products. Also when they choose different clouds , they use the cloud provider supprted services and create a composure of those services to define the common application blocks.Developing and managing those common app blocks for multiple products in different cloud involves a large effort and huge learning cycle.Also they spent a lot of time in writing the services lifecycle , operation and security aspects. 


Appkube platform delivers those common application blocks as reusable software components that compose few cloud native micro services delivered by cloud provider and includes lifecycle the management, instrumentation and operational management aspects.Engineering team can reuse those common blocks and deliver products in any cloud in a unified way. They enjoy the flexibility to choose any cloud and reduce a lengthy learning cycle. They can drag and drop the common services in visual designer and choose the cloud and architectures of those common services. Appkube platform seamlessly deploy them to any cloud with all instrumentation and operation lifecycle management.That saves the engineering team effort on learning the cloud services and creating automations for the service lifecycle management. Engineering team can focus on business specific blocks and readymade common blocks can deliver the API's that is cloud and architecture agnostics. This great reduce any new product development or legacy product transformation effort.Engineering team can repeat your success in delivering products and keep improving the common blocks API across the products.
